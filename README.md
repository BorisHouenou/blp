Python implementation of Aviv Nevo's Matlab code for the BLP model detailed in 
<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/t0221.pdf">A Research Assistant's Guide to Random Coefficient Discrete Choice Models of Demand</a>.

Comments in the code partially adapted from <a href ="http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~ane686/supplements/rc_dc_code.htm">Nevo's code</a> 
as well as the <a href="http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/bhhall/e220c/readme.html">description of the input data</a> from Bronwyn Hall.

TODO: Test jacobian function -- most likely incorrect.
